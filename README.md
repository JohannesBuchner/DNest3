DNest 3
==========

This is a reimplementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, since my C++ skills
have improved. It has improved performance (in terms of the sampling overhead, 
I still expect likelihood evaluations to dominate) and is cleaner code.
It has almost all of the features that the older DNest has.
